# Bangladesh: July to August - The Farewell of Sheikh Hasina

## Key Points
- In July 2024, student protests in Bangladesh over a controversial job quota system escalated into a nationwide movement against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government.
- The protests, initially peaceful, turned violent, resulting in nearly 300 deaths and thousands of injuries, prompting international concern.
- On August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina resigned after 15 years in power and fled to India, marking a significant political shift.
- An interim government led by Muhammad Yunus was formed to stabilize the country and prepare for new elections, but challenges like economic turmoil and rising sectarian tensions persist.
- The events reflect deep-seated issues with governance, including allegations of authoritarianism and corruption, though Hasina’s supporters highlight her economic achievements.

## Overview of the Events
In the summer of 2024, Bangladesh experienced a seismic political upheaval driven by student-led protests. What began as a demand to reform a government job quota system quickly grew into a broader call for change, culminating in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The protests highlighted frustrations with governance, economic inequality, and restricted opportunities, particularly among the youth. The violent response from authorities, including hundreds of deaths, intensified public anger, leading to Hasina’s departure and the establishment of an interim government.

## Why Did the Protests Start?
The spark for the protests was the reinstatement of a quota system for government jobs, which reserved 56% of positions for specific groups, including 30% for descendants of 1971 war veterans. Students argued this system favored political allies of Hasina’s Awami League party and limited merit-based opportunities. The Supreme Court’s decision to reduce the quota to 6% came too late to quell the unrest, as the movement had already expanded to address broader grievances against Hasina’s leadership.

## What Happened Next?
The protests, starting peacefully in July, turned deadly as the government deployed police and military forces. Clashes on August 4, 2024, resulted in at least 95 deaths, with nearly 300 total fatalities by early August. On August 5, protesters stormed Hasina’s residence, prompting her resignation and flight to India. The interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, now faces the task of restoring stability and addressing the underlying issues that fueled the unrest.

## What’s the Current Situation?
As of April 2025, Bangladesh is navigating a complex transition. The interim government is working to stabilize the economy and prepare for elections, but faces challenges like corruption, unemployment, and rising tensions with minority groups. The student movement remains influential, with some activists taking roles in governance, signaling a shift toward youth-driven politics. However, concerns about Islamist parties and regional stability, particularly with India, add uncertainty to the country’s future.

# Bangladesh’s 2024 Political Upheaval: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction
In July and August 2024, Bangladesh witnessed a transformative political crisis that led to the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ending her 15-year tenure. Sparked by student protests over a controversial job quota system, the movement rapidly evolved into a nationwide uprising against her government, driven by allegations of authoritarianism, corruption, and economic mismanagement. The violent response from authorities, resulting in nearly 300 deaths, intensified public outrage, culminating in Hasina’s departure on August 5, 2024. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus now governs, tasked with stabilizing the nation and preparing for elections. This article explores the events, their causes, and their implications for Bangladesh’s future, drawing on detailed accounts from reputable sources.

## Background on Sheikh Hasina and Her Government

### Who Is Sheikh Hasina?
Sheikh Hasina Wazed, often called the "Iron Lady" of Bangladesh, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding father. She first served as Prime Minister from 1996 to 2001 and returned to power in 2009, leading until 2024. Her leadership was shaped by her father’s legacy and the 1975 assassination of most of her family, which some argue drove her to consolidate power ([Elections: Sheikh Hasina’s Democratic Legacy](https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-elections-sheikh-hasina-opposition-bnp-485da99f50959e6cdf5b11e24fe6efe5)).

### Achievements
Hasina’s government oversaw significant economic growth, transforming Bangladesh into a lower-middle-income nation with GDP growth rates above 6% for over a decade. The country became a global hub for ready-made garments, and infrastructure projects like the Padma Bridge and Dhaka Metro Rail enhanced connectivity ([Timeline: Rise and Fall of Sheikh Hasina](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/timeline-sheikh-hasinas-reign-ends-after-15-years)).

### Criticisms
Despite economic progress, Hasina’s rule faced substantial criticism:
- **Authoritarianism**: Her government was accused of suppressing dissent, manipulating elections, and harassing opposition parties like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). The 2014 and 2018 elections were criticized for irregularities, with the BNP boycotting polls ([Bangladesh PM’s Authoritarian Turn](https://time.com/6330463/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-wazed-profile/)).
- **Corruption**: Allegations of rampant corruption persisted, with an estimated $150 billion siphoned out of the country illegally ([Sheikh Hasina Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina)).
- **Economic Mismanagement**: Rising foreign debt, inflation, and youth unemployment fueled discontent, particularly among young Bangladeshis ([Bangladesh After Hasina](https://www.asiapacific.ca/publication/bangladesh-after-hasina-political-upheaval-economic-turmoil)).
- **Human Rights Abuses**: The government’s use of force, including extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, drew international condemnation. A 2025 UN report suggested Hasina personally directed the 2024 protest crackdown, potentially constituting crimes against humanity ([Sheikh Hasina Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina)).

## The Quota System Controversy

### What Was the Quota System?
Introduced in the 1970s, the quota system reserved government jobs for specific groups, including descendants of 1971 liberation war veterans, women, and people from underdeveloped districts. By 2024, 56% of jobs were reserved, with 30% for veterans’ descendants, seen as favoring Awami League allies ([Quota System of Bangladesh Civil Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quota_system_of_Bangladesh_Civil_Service)).

### Why Was It Controversial?
Students argued the system undermined merit-based hiring, limiting opportunities in a competitive job market where government positions offer stability and benefits. The High Court’s June 2024 reinstatement of the quota, after its 2018 abolition, reignited protests, as students felt it perpetuated inequality and cronyism ([Bangladesh Court Scraps Quotas](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-extends-curfew-ahead-court-hearing-controversial-job-quotas-2024-07-21/)).

### Judicial Response
Following violent protests, the Supreme Court reduced the quota to 6% on July 21, 2024, allocating 5% for veterans’ descendants and 2% for minorities and disabled individuals, with 93% of jobs merit-based. However, this decision came too late to de-escalate the situation ([Bangladesh Top Court Scraps Quotas](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/21/bangladesh-court-scraps-most-job-quotas-that-caused-deadly-unrest-reports)).

## The 2024 Student Protests

### Origins and Escalation
The protests began in early July 2024 as students from universities like Dhaka University demanded quota reform. Initially peaceful, the movement gained traction, drawing professionals, workers, and opposition supporters. By August, the protests had evolved into a broader call for Hasina’s resignation, fueled by economic grievances and dissatisfaction with her governance ([Student-Led Movement](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/the-student-led-movement-and-the-downfall-of-the-bangladesh-government/)).

### Government Response
The government’s response was heavy-handed:
- **Use of Force**: Police and paramilitary forces used tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, resulting in nearly 300 deaths and thousands of injuries. On August 4, 95 people, including 14 police officers, died in Dhaka clashes ([Timeline of Bangladesh Protests](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/from-protests-to-sheikh-hasina-resignation-timeline-of-bangladesh-student-protest/article68488361.ece)).
- **Curfews and Internet Shutdowns**: A nationwide curfew and internet blackout were imposed, seen as authoritarian tactics to suppress dissent ([How Students Brought Down Government](https://intpolicydigest.org/the-platform/how-bangladeshi-students-brought-down-an-authoritarian-government/)).
- **Arrests**: Over 11,000 people were arrested, further escalating tensions ([Timeline of Bangladesh Protests](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/from-protests-to-sheikh-hasina-resignation-timeline-of-bangladesh-student-protest/article68488361.ece)).

## The Resignation of Sheikh Hasina

On August 5, 2024, facing overwhelming protests, Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India via a military helicopter, landing at Hindan Air Force Station. Her departure was confirmed by Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, who announced the formation of an interim government ([Resignation of Sheikh Hasina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resignation_of_Sheikh_Hasina)). Protesters celebrated by storming her residence, looting and vandalizing it, and defacing symbols of her regime, including statues of her father ([Euphoria in Bangladesh](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywww69p2vo)).

## Aftermath and Current Situation

### Interim Government
President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament and appointed Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist, to lead an interim government. Yunus, critical of Hasina’s policies, is tasked with stabilizing the economy, addressing corruption, and organizing elections ([Fall of Hasina Government](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10096/)). The government includes student activists like Nahid Islam, signaling a shift toward youth-driven governance ([New Political Player](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/27/g-s1-55611/bangladesh-student-activists-sheikh-hasina-nahid-islam)).

### Challenges
As of April 2025, the interim government faces significant hurdles:
- **Economic Turmoil**: High inflation, unemployment, and a bloated bureaucracy threaten stability ([Bangladesh After Hasina](https://www.asiapacific.ca/publication/bangladesh-after-hasina-political-upheaval-economic-turmoil)).
- **Sectarian Tensions**: The lifting of bans on Islamist parties and attacks on Hindu minorities have raised fears of an Islamist shift and strained ties with India ([Hasina’s Departure](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/08/sheikh-hasinas-departure-exposes-fractures-bangladeshs-politics)).
- **Political Fragmentation**: The interim government must build consensus amid competing interests, including the newly formed National Citizen’s Party by student activists ([Bangladesh After Hasina](https://www.asiapacific.ca/publication/bangladesh-after-hasina-political-upheaval-economic-turmoil)).

### Recent Developments
In February 2025, protests flared again when Hasina attempted to address the nation from India, leading to the demolition of her father’s historic residence. The interim government condemned the vandalism but faces ongoing challenges in maintaining order ([Fresh Violence](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/asia/bangladesh-protest-students-sheikh-hasina.html)).

## Analysis and Implications

### Domestic Impact
The 2024 protests highlight the power of youth activism in challenging entrenched power structures. The movement’s success in ousting Hasina demonstrates the potential for grassroots change but also underscores deep-seated issues like corruption and inequality. The interim government’s ability to implement reforms before the planned 2025 elections will determine whether Bangladesh can avoid further instability ([Student Movement Transformed Nation](https://lpeproject.org/blog/the-bangladesh-student-movement-that-transformed-a-nation/)).

### Regional Implications
India, a historical ally of Hasina, faces challenges with the new government, particularly over minority attacks and Islamist influences. The 4,000-kilometer border with Bangladesh raises concerns about spillover effects ([Hasina’s Departure](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/08/sheikh-hasinas-departure-exposes-fractures-bangladeshs-politics)). The events also highlight tensions between Western and Indian foreign policy priorities, as India and China shielded Hasina from criticism ([Geopolitics and Revolution](https://saisreview.sais.jhu.edu/geopolitics-and-revolution-the-superpower-nexus-behind-hasinas-rule-and-the-future-of-bangladeshs-foreign-policy/)).

### Global Lessons
The Bangladesh uprising offers lessons for other nations facing similar issues of authoritarianism and youth discontent. The role of social media in organizing protests, despite government crackdowns, underscores the evolving nature of political activism ([How Students Brought Down Government](https://intpolicydigest.org/the-platform/how-bangladeshi-students-brought-down-an-authoritarian-government/)).

## Conclusion
The resignation of Sheikh Hasina in August 2024 marked a turning point for Bangladesh, driven by a student-led movement that exposed deep flaws in governance. While the interim government under Muhammad Yunus offers hope for democratic reform, challenges like economic instability and sectarian tensions loom large. The events of July and August 2024 will shape Bangladesh’s political landscape for years, serving as a testament to the power of collective action and the complexities of transitioning to a more inclusive future.
