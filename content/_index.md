# Who Am I?

Hey there! I'm **revWhiteShadow**, also known as **White9shadow**, a passionate developer from Bangladesh. My world revolves around **Android optimization**, **frontend performance**, **free software**, and **security**. I believe that **smart tech** shouldn’t be locked down. Whether it’s Android, Linux, or web development, my mission is clear:

> **Born to revolution. Be the revolutionary.**

I don’t just use technology — I reshape it, break its limits, and push it further than anyone expects. Whether it's speeding up Android or pushing Linux to its limits, I’m in the trenches making sure nothing stands in the way of *true* system control.

### What I Do

- **Magisk Module Development**:  
  I craft performance-centric modules like **GODSPEED MODE**, **BOOTLOOP SAVER**, and **GS-ZRAM** for advanced users who demand full control over their Android systems.

- **Non-Root Tweaks**:  
  Tools like **NOROR** let non-rooted users dive deep into system tweaks, offering significant performance boosts while maintaining stability and security.

- **Linux Tweaks & Scripting**:  
  From **Termux** to **Kali Nethunter**, I push the boundaries of Linux and Android, optimizing them beyond what most people think is possible. I also write powerful Linux scripts to automate tasks and improve system performance.

- **SEO Expertise**:  
  I specialize in optimizing websites for search engines, ensuring that content gets the visibility it deserves. From on-page SEO to technical optimizations, I use best practices to help websites rank higher and perform better.

- **Bug Hunting & Security Research**:  
  I actively engage in bug hunting and vulnerability research to help improve system security. Whether it's identifying security flaws in apps, kernels, or Magisk modules, I’m constantly searching for ways to enhance safety.

- **Account Cracking**:  
  While I advocate for ethical hacking, I also have experience in penetration testing and security assessments. My focus is on identifying vulnerabilities to help secure systems, not exploit them.

- **Open-Source Contributions**:  
  Every script, tweak, and module I create is open-source. It’s about making powerful optimizations available to everyone, empowering users to take control of their devices.

### Skills & Tools

- **Android**: Magisk modules, shell scripting, performance optimization
- **Linux**: Bash scripting, Zsh, BusyBox, ADB, Kali Nethunter, Debian packaging
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS (minimal UI design)
- **SEO**: On-page SEO, keyword optimization, technical SEO
- **Security**: Bug hunting, penetration testing, ethical hacking, account cracking
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **Community Platforms**: Pling
